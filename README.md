# Biogeography-Based-Signal-Features
%% Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) Signal Features - Created in 19 Jan 2022 by Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi
% This code employs Biogeography Based Optimization BBO evolutionary 
% algorithm in order to extract audio signal feature.
% System takes audio signal from input and extracts 'Energy Entropy'
% feature from spatial domain and 'Spectral Centroid' feature from
% frequency domain as input and target is 'Short Time Energy' feature from time
% domain. BBO algorithm fits the final feature vector based on its nature
% and returns evolutionary signal feature. BBO is suitable for this
% purpose due to its high speed for multiple signal feature extraction
% task. You can use your own audio signal or any other type of signal and play
% with parameters depending on your system and the lenght of the signal.
